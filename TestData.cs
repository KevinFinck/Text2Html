1. Why was the Notice issued?
A Court authorized this website because you have a right to know about a proposed Settlement of this class action lawsuit and about options, before the Court decides whether to give final approval to the Settlement. The website and the Notice you were sent explain the lawsuit, the Settlement, and your legal rights. 
The case is called Patino v. Film at Lincoln Center, Inc., Index No. 504682/2024, pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Kings. The person who sued is called the Plaintiff. The Defendant is Film at Lincoln Center, Inc.
2. What is a class action?
In a class action, one or more people called Class Representatives (in this case, Regina Patino) sue on behalf of a group or a “Class” of people who have similar claims. In a class action, the Court resolves the issues for all Settlement Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from the Settlement Class.
3. What is this lawsuit about?
This lawsuit claims Defendant failed to properly disclose a ticket convenience fee for electronic tickets to its theaters prior to those tickets being selected for purchase, in alleged violation of ACAL § 25.07(4). Defendant denies that it violated any law, but has agreed to the Settlement to avoid the uncertainties and expenses associated with continuing the case.

4. Why is there a Settlement?
The Court has not decided whether the Plaintiff or the Defendant should win this case. Instead, both sides agreed to a Settlement. That way, they avoid the uncertainties and expenses associated with ongoing litigation, and Settlement Class Members will get compensation sooner rather than, if at all, after the completion of a trial.

5.  How do I know if I am in the Settlement Class?
The Court decided that everyone who fits the following description is a member of the Settlement Class:
All individuals who paid a Convenience Fee to gain entrance to any of Defendant’s theaters located in New York state from Defendant’s website, mobile application, or any other Defendant’s owned or operated online platform from August 29, 2022, to and through February 21, 2024.
“Places of Entertainment” means Defendant’s movie theaters, including, but not limited to, Walter Reade Theater and the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center.
“Defendant’s Website” means https://www.filmlinc.org/. 

6.  What does the Settlement provide?	
Monetary Relief. A Settlement Fund has been created totaling $400,000.00. Payments to Settlement Class Members, and the cost to administer the Settlement, the cost to inform people about the Settlement, attorneys’ fees (inclusive of litigation costs), and an award to the Class Representative will also come out of this fund (see Question 12). 
Prospective Relief. Additionally, Defendant acknowledges that it has changed the purchase flow for tickets on its website to display the convenience fee that was the subject of this litigation when the ticket is first selected for purchase and will agree to comply with New York ACAL § 25.07(4).
A detailed description of the Settlement benefits can be found in the Settlement Agreement, a copy of which is available on the Important Documents Page.


7.  How much will my payment be?
To receive a pro rata, share of the Settlement Fund, which will be based on the total amount of convenience fees you paid, you must submit a timely and complete Claim Form no later than April 25, 2025. You can file a claim by clicking [here.] Your payment will by PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, or check, at your election. Claim Forms must be submitted online by 11:59 p.m. EST on April 25, 2025, or postmarked and mailed by April 25, 2025. You can contact Class Counsel at (646) 837-7150 to inquire as to the number of claims and/or requests for exclusion that have been received to date. 

8.  When will I get my payment?
The hearing to consider the fairness of the Settlement is scheduled for May 12, 2025. If the Court approves the settlement, eligible Settlement Class Members whose claims were approved by the Settlement Administrator will receive their payment 28 calendar days after April 25, 2025. The payment will be made in the form of a check, unless you elect to receive payment by PayPal, Zelle, or Venmo, and all checks will expire and become void 180 days after they are issued. If your address has changed, please inform the Settlement Administrator promptly to avoid any delays in receiving your payment.

9.  How do I get a payment?
If you are a Settlement Class Member and you want to get a payment, you must complete and submit a Claim Form by April 25, 2025. Claim Forms can be found and submitted by clicking here , or by printing and mailing a paper Claim Form, copies of which are available for download here. Failure to submit a timely claim by the Claims Deadline will prevent you from receiving a settlement payment from the Settlement Fund.
We also encourage you to submit your claim on-line. Not only is it easier and more secure, but it is completely free and takes only minutes! 

10.  What am I giving up if I stay in the Class?
If the Settlement becomes final, you will give up your right to sue the Defendant and other Released Parties for the claims being resolved by this Settlement. The specific claims you are giving up against the Defendant are described in the Settlement Agreement. You will be “releasing” the Defendant and its affiliates, employees, and representatives as described in Section 1.33 of the Settlement Agreement. Unless you exclude yourself (see Question 13), you are “releasing” the claims, regardless of whether you claim your Settlement benefit or not. The Settlement Agreement is available here.
The Settlement Agreement describes the released claims with specific descriptions, so read it carefully. If you have any questions you can talk to the lawyers listed in Question 11 for free or you can, of course, talk to your own lawyer if you have questions about what this means.

11. Do I have a lawyer in the case?
The Court has appointed Philip L. Fraietta and Stefan Bogdanovich of Bursor & Fisher, P.A. to be the attorneys representing the Settlement Class. They are called “Class Counsel.” They believe, after conducting an extensive investigation, the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Settlement Class. You will not be charged for these lawyers. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer in this case, you may hire one at your expense.


12. How will the lawyers be paid?
The Defendant has agreed that Class Counsel’s attorneys’ fees and costs may be paid out of the Settlement Fund in an amount to be determined by the Court. The fee petition will seek no more than one-third of the Settlement Fund, inclusive of reimbursement of their costs and expenses; the Court may award less than this amount. Under the Settlement Agreement, any amount awarded to Class Counsel will be paid out of the Settlement Fund.

Subject to approval by the Court, Defendant has agreed that the Class Representative may be paid a service award of $10,000 from the Settlement Fund for her services in helping to bring and resolve this case.

13. How do I get out of the Settlement?
To exclude yourself from the Settlement, you must submit a request for exclusion by 11:59 p.m. EST on April 21, 2025. Requests for exclusion may be submitted either online here or by mailing or otherwise delivering a letter (or request for exclusion) stating that you want to be excluded from the Patino v. Film at Lincoln Center, Inc., Index No. 504682/2024 settlement. Your letter or request for exclusion must also include your name, your address, a statement that you purchased electronic tickets to Defendant’s Places of Entertainment from Defendant’s Website, from August 29, 2022, through and including February 21, 2024, and paid a convenience fee in connection with such purchase, your signature, the name and number of this case, and a statement that you wish to be excluded. If you choose to submit a request for exclusion by mail, you must mail or deliver your exclusion request, postmarked no later than April 21, 2025, to the following address:

Film at Lincoln Center Ticket Fee Settlement
PO Box 5357
Portland, OR 97228-5357

14. If I don’t exclude myself, can I sue the Defendant for the same thing later?
No. Unless you exclude yourself, you give up any right to sue the Defendant for the claims being resolved by this Settlement.

15. If I exclude myself, can I get anything from this Settlement?
No. If you exclude yourself, you will not receive any payment from the Settlement Fund.

16. How do I object to the Settlement?
If you are a member of the Settlement Class, you can object to the Settlement if you don’t like any part of it. You can give reasons why you think the Court should not approve it. The Court will consider your views. To object, you must file with the Court a letter or brief stating that you object to the Settlement in Patino v. Film at Lincoln Center, Inc., Index No. 504682/2024; identify all your reasons for your objections (including citations and supporting evidence) and attach any materials you rely on for your objections. Your letter or brief must also include your name, your address, the basis upon which you claim to be a member of the Settlement Class, the name and contact information of any and all attorneys representing, advising, or in any way assisting you in connection with your objection, and your signature. If you, or an attorney assisting you with your objection, have ever objected to any class action settlement where you or the objecting attorney has asked for or received payment in exchange for dismissal of the objection (or any related appeal) without modification to the settlement, you must include a statement in your objection identifying each such case by full case caption. You must also mail or deliver a copy of your letter or brief to Class Counsel and Defendant’s Counsel listed below. 
Class Counsel will file with the Court and post on this website its request for attorneys’ fees by March 24, 2025.
If you want to appear and speak at the Final Approval Hearing to object to the Settlement, with or without a lawyer (explained below in answer to Question 20), you must say so in your letter or brief. File the objection with the Court (or mail the objection to the Court) and mail a copy of the objection to Class Counsel and Defendant’s Counsel, at the addresses below, postmarked no later than April 21, 2025.

17. What’s the difference between objecting and excluding myself from the Settlement?
Objecting simply means telling the Court you do not like something about the Settlement.  You can object only if you stay in the Settlement Class.  Excluding yourself from the Settlement Class is telling the Court you don’t want to be part of the Settlement Class.  If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because the case no longer affects you.
18. When and where will the Court decide whether to approve the Settlement?
The Court will hold the Final Approval Hearing at 10:00 AM on May 12, 2025, in Courtroom 4.38 at the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Kings, 320 Jay Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201. The purpose of the hearing will be for the Court to determine whether to approve the Settlement as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Settlement Class; to consider the Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees and expenses; and to consider the request for a Service Award to the Class Representative. At that hearing, the Court will be available to hear any objections and arguments concerning the fairness of the Settlement.
The hearing may be postponed to a different date or time without notice, so it is a good idea to check for updates by visiting the Settlement Website or calling 888-718-4126. If, however, you timely objected to the Settlement and advised the Court you intend to appear and speak at the Final Approval Hearing, you will receive notice of any change in the date of the Final Approval Hearing.

19. Do I have to come to the hearing?
No.  Class Counsel will answer any questions the Court may have.  But you are welcome to come at your own expense.  If you send an objection or comment, you do not have to come to Court to talk about it.  If you filed and mailed your written objection on time, the Court will consider it.  You may also pay another lawyer to attend, but it is not required. 
20. May I speak at the hearing?
Yes. You may ask the Court for permission to speak at the Final Approval Hearing. To do so, you must include in your letter or brief objecting to the settlement a statement saying that it is your “Notice of Intent to Appear in Patino v. Film at Lincoln Center, Inc., Index No. 504682/2024.” It must include your name, address, telephone number and signature as well as the name and address of your lawyer, if one is appearing for you. Your objection and notice of intent to appear must be filed with the Court and postmarked no later than April 21, 2025, and be sent to the addresses listed in Question 16.

21. Where do I get more information?
These FAQs summarize the Settlement. More details are in the Settlement Agreement. You can get a copy of the Settlement Agreement here . You may also write with questions to Lincoln Center Ticket Fee Settlement, PO Box 5357, Portland, OR 97228-5357. You can call the Settlement Administrator at 888-718-4126 or Class Counsel at (646) 837-7150, if you have any questions. Before doing so, however, please read all of these FAQs carefully.

        // Sample from CA40070001 Tan v Quick Box
        public static string TanVQuickBox = @"

           1. Why should I read this website?
           If you were billed for La Pura Products between June 20, 2016 and September 9, 2024, you are a member of a Settlement Class.
           This website explains the class action lawsuit, the proposed Settlement, your legal rights, what benefits are available, who is eligible for the benefits, and how to get the benefits.
           The Court in charge of this case is the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The lawsuit is known as Tan v. Quick Box LLC, Case No. 3:20-cv-01082. You may obtain additional updates on the status of the case by contacting Class Counsel (listed in Question 11 below), checking back to this website for updates, or viewing case information through the Court’s system at www.Pacer.gov.
           Back to Top
           2. What is this lawsuit about?
           This lawsuit is about whether La Pura Products were marketed in a false or misleading way. “La Pura Products” is a defined term under the Settlement Agreement, meaning “any product manufactured, marketed, sold, or otherwise promoted under the La Pura brand name or any variation thereof, including (but not limited to) La’Pura and LaPura.” The suit alleges that Quick Box Defendants fulfilled these orders regarding La Pura Products. Defendant denies that it did anything wrong. This Settlement is not an admission of any liability. The Court has not decided who is right.
            Back to Top
           3. Why is the lawsuit a class action?
           In a class action lawsuit, one or more people called “Class Representatives” sue on behalf of other people who have similar claims. The people together are a “Class” or “Class Members.” The people who sue – and all the Class Members like them – are called the “Plaintiffs.” The company the Plaintiffs sued (in this case Quick Box LLC, among others) is called the “Defendant.” One court resolves the issues for everyone in the Class – except for those people who choose to exclude themselves from the Class. U.S. District Judge Linda Lopez is in charge of this class action.
           Back to Top
           4. Why is there a Settlement?
           The Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiffs or Defendant. Instead, both sides agreed to a settlement. By agreeing to settle, both sides avoid the cost and risk of a trial, and people who submit valid claims will get compensation. The Class Representative her their attorneys believe the Settlement is best for the Settlement Class and its members.
           Back to Top
           5. Am I part of the Settlement?
           You are a Class Member if you were billed for La Pura Products between June 20, 2016 and September 9, 2024.
           Excluded from the Settlement are: (i) jurists and mediators who are or have presided over the Action, Plaintiff’s Counsel and Defendants’ Counsel, their employees, legal representatives, heirs, successors, assigns, or any members of their immediate family; (ii) any government entity; (iii) The Quick Box Parties and any entity in which The Quick Box Parties have a controlling interest, any of their subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, and officers, directors, employees, legal representatives, heirs, successors, or assigns, or any members of their immediate family; and (iv) any persons who timely opt out of the Settlement Class.
           Back to Top
           6. What does the Settlement provide?
           The $5.5 million Settlement Fund will provide Monetary Payments to Class Members who submit valid claims. Class notice and claim administration expenses, Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s attorneys’ fees and expenses and any service award to the Class Representative (discussed below) will also be paid out of the Settlement Fund, if approved by the Court. The settlement distribution process will be administered by an independent Settlement Administrator approved by the Court.
           Back to Top
           7. What can I get from the Settlement?
           If you file a Pre-Populated Claim Form, you will be provided a Monetary Payment based on your purchases of La Pura Products as reflected in purchase records. The Monetary Payment is subject to a pro rata increase or decrease depending upon the amount remaining in the Net Fund after all eligible Claims are determined.
           Based on the applicable purchase records, the Settlement Administrator will determine and notify Class Members of the Monetary Payment, the amount of Class Members can receive via the Settlement Agreement.
           Any money remaining in the Settlement Fund after payment of settlement notice and administration, attorneys’ fees and costs (Question 12 below), and Class Representative service awards (Question 12 below) ordered by the Court, and valid Class Member claims, will be paid pursuant to the cy pres doctrine to the National Consumer Law Center.
           Back to Top
           8. How can I get my Monetary Payment?
           If you are a Class Member, you must fill out and submit a Claim Form to qualify for a Monetary Payment. You can easily file your Claim online here.  You can also download a paper Claim Form from this website or get one by calling the Settlement Administrator at 1-877-658-0293. The completed Claim Form must be submitted online by February 5, 2025, or by mail at the address below, received by February 5, 2025.

           Portland, OR 97208-2449
           Upon receiving a completed Claim Form, the Settlement Administrator will review the documentation and confirm or deny your eligibility for an award.
           Back to Top
           9. When will I receive my Monetary Payment?
           The Court will hold a hearing on January 6, 2025 (which is subject to change), to decide whether to approve the Settlement. Even if the Court approves the Settlement, there may be appeals. The appeal process can take time, perhaps more than a year. You will not receive your Monetary Payment until any appeals are resolved. Please be patient.
           Back to Top
           10. What am I giving up to receive these Settlement benefits?
           Unless you exclude yourself (“opt out”) from the Settlement Class by timely submitting an Exclusion Request (see Questions 13-14 below), you will remain in the Settlement Class. By remaining in the Settlement Class you “release” and can’t sue, continue to sue, or be part of any other lawsuit against the Quick Box Defendants about the “Released Claims” in this case. These Released Claims are only those claims that you could have brought based on the identical factual predicate of those claims brought in this case about the alleged misleading marketing and labeling of La Pura Products between June 20, 2016 and September 9, 2024.
           The Settlement Agreement at Section VIII (titled “Releases”) describes these “Released Claims” and the “Released Parties” in necessary legal terminology, so read these sections carefully. The Settlement Agreement is available on this website or in the public court records on file in this lawsuit. For questions regarding the Releases or what they mean, you can also talk to one of the lawyers listed in Question 11 below for free, or you can, talk to your own lawyer at your own expense.
           Back to Top
           11. Do I have lawyers in this case?
           The Court has appointed attorneys from the law firm Kneupper & Covey, PC of Huntington Beach, CA, to represent you and the other Class Members. The lawyers are called Class Counsel. They are experienced in handling similar class action cases. You will not be charged for these lawyers. If you want to be represented by your own lawyer, you may hire one at your own expense.
           You may contact Class Counsel if you have any questions about this Notice or the Settlement. Please do not contact the Court.

           12. How will the lawyers be paid?
           Class Counsel will ask the Court for an award of attorneys’ fees of up to 1/3 of the Settlement Fund ($1,833,333.33) and for reimbursement of expenses incurred through the date of the Settlement ($84,040.37) and additional expenses incurred related to this notice and the administration of payment of the award (which will be disclosed in the motion for attorney's fees and costs, but are currently estimated at $124,456). Any award of attorneys’ fees and costs will be paid from the Settlement Fund. Class Counsel will also ask the Court for a service award for the Class Representative (up to $6,000). The purpose of the service awards is to compensate the Plaintiff for her time, efforts and risks taken on behalf of the Settlement Class. Any award of payment to the Class Representative will be paid from the Settlement Fund.
           Back to Top
           13. How do I get out of the Settlement?
           If you don’t want a Monetary Payment, but want to keep the right to sue or continue to sue the Quick Box Defendants on your own, on the basis of the legal issues in this case, then you must take steps to exclude yourself from the Settlement (get out of the Settlement). This is called “excluding yourself”—or is sometimes referred to as “opting out” of the Settlement Class.
           To exclude yourself from the Settlement, you must send a “Request for Exclusion” in the form of a letter or Request for Exclusion form stating that you want to be excluded from Tan v. Quick Box LLC, Case No. 3:20-cv-01082. Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and basis upon which you are a Class Member. You must mail your Request for Exclusion received by December 23, 2024 to: Tan v. Quick Box Settlement Administrator, P.O. Box 2449, Portland, OR 97208-2449. A Request for Exclusion form can also be obtained on this website.
           If you do not follow these procedures and deadlines, you will remain a Class Member and lose any opportunity to exclude yourself from the Settlement. This means that your rights will be determined in this lawsuit by the Settlement Agreement if it receives final approval from the Court.
           Back to Top
           14. If I exclude myself, can I get anything from the Settlement?
           No. If you exclude yourself, you cannot receive Monetary Payments. But, you may sue, continue to sue, or be part of a different lawsuit against the Quick Box Defendants about the legal issues in this case.
           Back to Top
           15. How do I tell the Court that I don’t like the Settlement?
           If you’re a Class Member, you can object to the Settlement if you don’t like any part of it. You can give reasons why you think the Court should not approve it. The Court will consider your views. Note: You can’t ask the Court to order a different Settlement; the Court can only approve or reject the Settlement. If the Court denies approval, no settlement awards will be sent out and the lawsuit will continue. If that is what you want to happen, you must object.
           To object, you must send a letter. Be sure to include the following information:
           a.	The case name and number (Tan v. Quick Box LLC, Case No. 3:20-cv-01082-LL-DDL);
           b.	Your name, address, telephone number and, if represented by counsel, the name, address, and telephone number of your counsel;
           c.	A statement under oath that you are a Class Member;
           d.	A statement whether you intend to appear at the Final Approval Hearing, either in person or through counsel;
           e.	A statement of all your objections and the specific grounds supporting your objections;
           f.	A statement whether the objection applies only to you, to a specific subset of the Settlement Class, or to the entire Settlement Class;
           g.	Copies of any papers, briefs, or other documents upon which your objection is based; and
           h.	Your handwritten, dated signature (the signature of your counsel, an electronic signature, and the annotation “/s” or similar annotation will not suffice).
           Your objection must be submitted to the Court either by mailing (or by filing it at any location of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California) and served on Class Counsel and Defendant’s Counsel received no later than December 23, 2024, to the following addresses:
           Court:
           Clerk
           United States District Court,
           Southern District of California
           221 West Broadway
           San Diego, CA 92101	Class Counsel:
           Kevin Kneupper
           Cyclone Covey
           Kneupper & Covey PC
           17011 Beach Blvd, Suite 900
           Huntington Beach, CA 92647	Defense Counsel:

           Thomas J. Tobin
           Perkins Coie LLP
           1888 Century Park East, Suite 1700
           Los Angeles, CA 90067
           If you timely file an objection it will be considered by the Court at the Final Approval Hearing. You do not need to attend the Final Approval Hearing for the Court to consider your objection.
           The Court will require substantial compliance with these requirements above. If you do not submit a written objection in accordance with the deadline and procedure set forth above, you will waive your right to be heard at the Final Approval Hearing. However, the Court may excuse your failure to file a written objection upon a showing of good cause, which, if granted, would permit you to still appear at the Final Approval Hearing and object to the Settlement.
           Back to Top
           16.What is the difference between objecting and asking to be excluded?
           Objecting is simply telling the Court that you don’t like something about the Settlement. You can object only if you stay in the Settlement Class. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you don’t want to be part of the Settlement Class. If you exclude yourself, you have no basis to object because you are no longer part of the case.

           At the hearing, the Court will hear any comments, objections, and arguments concerning the fairness of the proposed Settlement, including the amount requested by Class Counsel for attorneys’ fees and expenses.

After the hearing, the Court will decide whether to approve the Settlement. We do not know how long these decisions will take.

           18.Do I have to attend the Final Approval Hearing?
           No. Class Counsel will answer all questions Judge Lopez may have. But, you are welcome to attend the hearing at your own expense. If you submit an objection, you do not have to attend the hearing to talk about your objection. As long as you filed your written objection by the deadline, the Judge will consider it. You may also pay your own lawyer to attend, but it is not necessary.

           19.May I speak at the Final Approval Hearing?
           As long as you do not exclude yourself, you can (but do not have to) participate and speak for yourself in this lawsuit and Settlement. This is called making an appearance. You can also have your own lawyer speak for you, but you will have to pay for the lawyer yourself.
           If you want to appear, or if you want your own lawyer instead of Class Counsel to speak for you in this lawsuit, you must send a letter saying that it is your “Notice of Intention to Appear in Tan v. Quick Box LLC.” Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number, and your signature. Your Notice of Intention to Appear must be received by December 30, 2024, and be sent to the Clerk of Court at the address listed in Question 15.
           If you want to speak at the Final Approval Hearing without having followed these procedures, you may do so if you demonstrate good cause to the Court.

           If you do nothing, you’ll be part of the Settlement Class, but get no Monetary Payment from the Settlement. Unless you exclude yourself, you will not be permitted to continue to assert Released Claims in any other lawsuit against the Quick Box Defendants about the legal issues in this case, ever again.
